# Breast-Cancer-Detection
A simple MLP which uses ADAM optimizer to predict the probability of breast cancer from an X-Ray image. 

The model uses 3 layers of Neural Networks each with 10 Neurons and predicts whether a tumors is cancerous or not. The model trains on 10,000 epochs to give testing accuracy of 93.89 %.
